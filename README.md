## Project Overview

“Advanced Data Visualisation Playground” is a project to:

- Provide a hands‑on environment for creating & testing various visualization types (interactive charts, maps, dashboards, etc.).  
- Enable data analysts, designers, and developers to experiment with both aesthetic and functional aspects of visualisation.  
- Serve as a portfolio / learning space — sample datasets, visual stories, and exploratory data analysis.

---

## Features

- Multiple chart types: line, bar, scatter, heatmap, choropleth maps, etc.  
- Interactivity: tooltips, zoom, pan, filtering.  
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.  
- Animations or transitions for data updates.  
- Support for real‑time or streaming data (if applicable).  
- Custom styling and theming.
